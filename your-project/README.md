## Project Description
Because we are from different spots in the world, and Barcelona is an international city, we wonder how different nationalities and languages have spread through the city.
Also, mapping in a funny way nationality preferences to find your perfect love and what languages skills you need to fancy them.

## Questions & Hypotheses
1. What are the top3 spoken languages in Barcelona (supposing each nationality has only one exclusive official language)? <br>
2. Where is Russian district in Barcelona? <br>
3. If you want to meet the love of your life, where should you go according to your sex preferences? <br>

## Dataset
Our DataSet is called "Official population's nationality classified by genre of the city of Barcelona".

The data refers to the readings of the living population of Barcelona on the first of January of 2019, approved by the INE (Instituto Nacinal de Estad√≠stica) and classified by nationality and genre.
